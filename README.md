This application was my first full-stack JavaScript with React-native.
RemedyDose is a comprehensive medication reminder app that enables users to log their medications,
with an added AI chatbot that fetches the user's medication from an Appwrite database.

The main features include:

1) Users logging, updating and deleting their medications
2) A local notification system handled by their device's operating system
3) Local authentication to avoid other people accessing a user's medications
4) A hugging face model that has access to the user's medications and logs through a database
5) A seperate chat function for users to be able to query the chatbot if they missed a dose
6) Users also have a quick reminder command using the 'r' command

This application was built using JavaScript, TypeScript, React-native (with React.js components) and Expo go
