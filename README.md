# Remedy Dose

This application was my first full-stack JavaScript with React-native.
Remedy Dose is a comprehensive medication reminder app that enables users to log their medications,
with an added AI chatbot that fetches the user's medication from an Appwrite database.

## Features
- âœ… Users logging, updating and deleting their medications
- âš¡ A local notification system handled by their device's operating system
- ðŸ”’ Local authentication to avoid other people accessing a user's medications
- ðŸ¤– A hugging face model that has access to the user's medications and logs through a database
- ðŸ“… A seperate chat function for users to be able to query the chatbot if they missed a dose
- ðŸŒ‡ Users also have a quick reminder command using the 'r' command

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript, TypeScript
- React Native, Expo and Appwrite (BaaS)
